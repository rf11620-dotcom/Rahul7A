    <p>But after a 10 year retirement in which Foreman became a priest before returning to the ring at the age of 38 years old and retaining the heavyweight title <br>
        and shocking the boxing world and all of those who laughed at him.<br>
    His coaches words where famed for what he told Foreman between rounds "You’re behind on points. You need a knockout to win. The time has come to do it.", and that he did. He landed a punishing right hand <br>
    after luring Moorer in to a slugfest by hitting light in the early rounds to get Moorer comfortable. Moorers corner was desperately trying to tell him it was a trap but  a young, arrogant, undefeated Moorer coming <br>
    off of a win against Evander Holyfield, viewed Foreman as to old to pose a real threat, but that was a miscalcuation.Foreman ended the fight with a right hand that left Moorer unable to eat the ref's count.<br>
   That night, George Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion in boxing history. </p>
